# Claude Code Session State for vpnctl Project

**Date:** 2025-07-19  
**Project:** vpnctl - VPN Profile Manager  
**Repository:** cdds-ab/vpnctl

## Project Overview

vpnctl is a bash-based VPN profile management tool with YAML configuration. The project has evolved from a simple VPN manager to a comprehensive tool with automated testing, coverage analysis, and release management.

## Current Architecture

### Core Components
- **Main Script:** `bin/vpnctl` - Central VPN management script
- **Configuration:** YAML-based config in `~/.config/vpn_config.yaml`
- **Installation:** `scripts/install.sh` and `scripts/uninstall.sh`
- **Completion:** Bash completion in `completions/vpnctl`

### Key Features Implemented
1. **VPN Management:** start, stop, status, backup, restore
2. **Backup Analytics:** `backup-stats` command for encrypted backup analysis
3. **Configurable Backup:** `set-backup` command with tab completion
4. **Multi-yq Support:** Both Go-yq and Python-yq compatibility
5. **Kill Switch:** `-k` flag for cleanup of existing tunnels

## Test Infrastructure (GitHub Issue #4)

### Testing Framework
- **BATS (Bash Automated Testing System):** 40 test cases
- **Coverage Analysis:** Function-based coverage tracking (44% coverage)
- **Matrix Testing:** Go-yq vs Python-yq environments
- **Test Files:**
  - `tests/test_vpnctl.bats` - Core functionality (19 tests)
  - `tests/test_set_backup.bats` - Backup configuration (9 tests)  
  - `tests/test_completion.bats` - Bash completion (12 tests)

### Coverage System
- **Tool:** Custom bash coverage analysis (`tests/coverage.sh`)
- **Functions Covered:** 4/9 (get_backup_file, set_backup_path, backup_stats, prepare_sudo)
- **Threshold:** 25% minimum (currently at 44%)
- **Reports:** HTML and JSON output with visualization

## CI/CD Pipeline

### GitHub Actions Workflows

#### Test Workflow (`.github/workflows/test.yml`)
- **Triggers:** Push to master/main, Pull Requests
- **Matrix:** Go-yq and Python-yq variants
- **Jobs:**
  - **test:** BATS test execution with matrix
  - **lint:** shellcheck validation and security scanning
  - **integration:** Installation/uninstallation testing
  - **security:** Hardcoded secrets detection
  - **coverage-summary:** Combined coverage reporting

#### Release Workflow (`.github/workflows/release.yml`)
- **Triggers:** Push to master/main (after successful tests)
- **Tools:** semantic-release with conventional commits
- **Assets:** vpnctl script, install/uninstall scripts, documentation, checksums
- **Versioning:** Automatic semantic versioning

## Automated Release System

### Configuration
- **semantic-release:** `.releaserc.yml` configuration
- **Conventional Commits:** Standardized commit message format
- **Commit Template:** `.gitmessage` for developers

### Commit Conventions
- `feat:` → MINOR version bump
- `fix:` → PATCH version bump
- `BREAKING CHANGE:` → MAJOR version bump
- `docs:`, `chore:`, `test:` → No release

### Current Releases
- **v1.0.0:** Initial automated release with all features
- **v1.0.1:** Bug fix for coverage badge permissions

## Code Quality & Security

### Static Analysis
- **shellcheck:** All scripts validated
- **Security Scan:** Automated detection of hardcoded secrets
- **Style:** Consistent bash scripting patterns

### Documentation
- **README.md:** Comprehensive usage and installation guide
- **CHANGELOG.md:** Automatically generated release notes
- **CONTRIBUTING.md:** Developer guidelines with commit conventions

## Development Workflow

### Local Development
```bash
# Run tests
./tests/run_tests.sh

# Run with coverage
./tests/coverage.sh run

# Install locally
./scripts/install.sh
```

### Contribution Process
1. Use conventional commit messages
2. Ensure tests pass locally
3. Push to trigger CI/CD
4. Automatic release on feat/fix commits

## Technical Debt & Future Improvements

### Potential Enhancements
1. **Increase Coverage:** Add tests for start_vpn, stop_vpn, status_vpn functions
2. **Integration Tests:** More comprehensive end-to-end testing
3. **Error Handling:** Enhanced validation and user feedback
4. **Performance:** Optimize backup operations for large configs

### Known Limitations
1. **Coverage Badge:** Static in README (auto-update removed due to permissions)
2. **Platform Support:** Currently Linux-focused
3. **Dependencies:** Requires yq (either variant)

## Project Status

### Completed
- ✅ Comprehensive test infrastructure (GitHub Issue #4)
- ✅ Automated release pipeline with semantic versioning
- ✅ Multi-environment CI/CD with matrix testing
- ✅ Coverage analysis and reporting
- ✅ Security scanning and quality checks
- ✅ Documentation and contributor guidelines

### Current State
- **Stable:** All tests passing, releases automated
- **Coverage:** 44% function coverage with 25% threshold
- **Releases:** v1.0.1 latest with automated changelog
- **CI/CD:** Fully functional with multiple validation stages
